				&emsp;&emsp;Your ability to purchase products from the Company is immediately suspended until we receive written confirmation from you that this violation has been fully and completely remedied.  Continued violations will result in permanent suspension.<br /><br />

				&emsp;&emsp;Violation of the MAP Policy is a serious offense, and can cause widespread market ramifications and harm to our brand in general.  The losses to the Company resulting from one violation can be significant. The Company vigorously defends its MAP Policy and will pursue all available legal remedies to enforce it.  The Company has not waived (and is not waiving) any of its rights or remedies arising in connection with the foregoing, and the Company hereby expressly reserves and preserves all such rights and remedies.<br /><br /><br /><br />
